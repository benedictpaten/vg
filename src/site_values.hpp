/** \file
 * The plain values the read-likelihood caller describes a site with, so that it needs no snarl
 * decomposition type once a site has been found.
 *
 * A site is its `SiteBounds`. An allele of a site is a `Traversal`: a walk of handles from the
 * site's start bound to its end bound. A star allele, for a strand that does not cross the site,
 * is an empty walk. The sites nested in a site sit in chains, and `SiteChildren` holds what the
 * site's records need to know about them.
 *
 * The conversions between these values and `Snarl` and `SnarlTraversal` are in namespace vg; the
 * caller's own types, and the functions that read them from a decomposition, are in
 * vg::multipass.
