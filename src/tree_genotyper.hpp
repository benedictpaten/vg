/**
 * The direct pass for one top-level site. It genotypes the site from its reads, gives it to the
 * linkage model and stages it, and then genotypes the sites below it: with nested calling, each
 * child chain its called alleles cross (see `ChildPlacer`); with top-down calling, each child
 * against the traversals its parent's called alleles allow. Each site below is staged in the same
 * way, and so on down. Records are built later, from the staged sites (see `RecordRenderer`).
 *
 * Several threads may genotype different top-level sites at once.
