# Linkage model

The **linkage model** is the second stage of `vg call --read-likelihood`'s genotyping. It chooses
the genotypes of neighbouring sites together, using the panel haplotypes. Alleles at nearby sites
are inherited together, so the sample's alleles at neighbouring sites tend to form combinations
that panel haplotypes also carry. The model uses this by treating each of the sample's strands as
a mosaic of panel haplotypes, as the
[Li–Stephens model](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/165.4.2213) does.

At each site the model uses the site likelihood $\mathcal{L}(G)$ of every genotype $G$, which
measures how well $G$ explains the site's reads; the allele that each panel haplotype carries there;
and the site's position. Direct genotyping computes the site likelihoods from each site's reads
alone, and the genotype with the highest is the site's **direct call**. The model runs along
**linkage chains**: sequences of sites in order of position, each holding the top-level sites of a
contig between changes of ploidy, or the sites of one child chain at one ploidy (and, at ploidy 1,
on one strand of the parent). Each time it runs, in a
[linkage pass](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#passes-and-rounds), it gives each site of a linkage
chain a **chosen genotype**, and it phases the chosen genotypes. The genotype it chooses in the last
pass is the site's **settled genotype**, the genotype that vg reports.

The caller as a whole is described in
[read-likelihood-genotyping.md](read-likelihood-genotyping.md), whose
[Vocabulary](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#vocabulary) defines terms used here, such as site,
strand, panel and phase. The site likelihood is derived in
[read-likelihood-direct-genotyping.md](read-likelihood-direct-genotyping.md).

## Differences from PanGenie

The model follows PanGenie ([Ebler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01043-w)). In
both, a hidden Markov model runs along a sequence of sites. The hidden state at a site is an
ordered pair of panel haplotypes, one for each of the sample's strands, and it implies a genotype:
the alleles that the two panel haplotypes carry there. Between sites, each strand can switch to
copying another panel haplotype. The forward–backward algorithm gives each state's posterior
probability, and a genotype's posterior is collected from the states that imply it. The Viterbi
algorithm gives the phase. This model differs from PanGenie's as follows.

- **Emissions.** PanGenie computes a state's emission from the counts, in the reads, of k-mers
  unique to the site. Here the emission is the site likelihood of the genotype that the state
  implies, which direct genotyping computes from the reads' alignments to the graph (see
  [States and emissions](#states-and-emissions)).
- **Mutation and escape.** PanGenie can call only alleles that some panel haplotype carries. Here,
  as in Li and Stephens' model, a strand that copies a panel haplotype carries another allele than
  the haplotype's with a small probability, a **mutation** (`--linkage-mutation`). So the model can
  call an allele that no panel haplotype carries at the site, and the strand keeps copying its
  haplotype through it. A strand that copies a panel haplotype that does not pass through the site
  has an unknown allele there, which can be any allele, at a fixed **escape** penalty (see
  [Mutation and escape](#mutation-and-escape)).
- **Switch probability.** PanGenie, as Li and Stephens did, redraws a strand's haplotype with
  probability $1 - \exp(-4 N_e r d / K)$, from the distance $d$, a recombination rate $r$, an
  effective population size $N_e$ and the panel size $K$. This model keeps the form
  $1 - \exp(-d/D)$, but sets the scale $D$ directly, with `--linkage-scale`, so that it does not
  change with $K$. It adds a floor, and raises the result to a power, the **linkage weight**
  (`--linkage-weight`). A redraw picks uniformly from the panel (see
  [Transitions](#transitions)).
- **Allele-frequency prior.** In both models, a genotype that many pairs of panel haplotypes carry
  is implied by many states, and so collects more posterior probability. PanGenie keeps this prior
  as the states imply it. This model raises it to a power, `--linkage-prior` (or `--hp-prior` at
  long homopolymers), which can strengthen or weaken it (see
  [Allele-frequency prior](#allele-frequency-prior)).
- **Windows.** PanGenie runs forward–backward along each chromosome as a whole. This model decodes
  a long linkage chain in overlapping windows of a fixed number of sites (see
  [Forward–backward windows](#forwardbackward-windows)).
- **Ploidy 1.** PanGenie's states are always pairs. Where the sample has one strand, the states
  here are single panel haplotypes: on a contig or region of ploidy 1,
  and at a nested site that only one strand passes through.
- **Nested sites.** PanGenie treats each top-level bubble as one site, with the variation nested in
  it folded into its alleles. This model also runs on sites nested inside other sites. It decodes
  parents before children, and starts each child chain from the panel haplotypes that the parent's
  strands copy (see [Linkage chains](#linkage-chains)).
- **Phasing.** PanGenie's Viterbi path is unrestricted, so the genotypes it implies need not be the
  posterior ones. Here the Viterbi path is restricted to states compatible with each site's
  chosen genotype, so phasing orders each genotype's alleles and keeps the genotype (see
  [Phasing from the panel](#phasing-from-the-panel)).

## States and emissions

At ploidy 2 the hidden state at a site is an ordered pair $(h_0, h_1)$: strand 0 copies $h_0$
there, and strand 1 copies $h_1$. Each of $h_0$ and $h_1$ is a panel haplotype, and the two can be
the same. At ploidy 1 the state is a single $h$.

A panel haplotype carries at most one allele at a site. It can take the walks of more than one
candidate allele there, when it passes through the site twice or is stored as several paths. vg
then takes it to carry the one that comes last in the site's list of candidate alleles (see
[Candidate alleles](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#candidate-alleles)), and drops the others.

At each site, the model works over the site's **compact allele set** $A_{\mathrm{c}}$, a subset of
its candidate alleles: the alleles of the site's direct call, and every allele that some panel
haplotype carries there. The model can choose for a site only a genotype made of these alleles. A
site whose compact allele set is larger than a fixed limit (see
[Fixed constants](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#fixed-constants)) is left out of the model. It
keeps its direct call, written unphased, and the model links the sites on either side of it
directly.

Each strand carries an allele of the compact allele set, drawn independently of the other strand's
with probability $P(b \mid h)$, given the haplotype $h$ it copies (see
[Mutation and escape](#mutation-and-escape)). A state's **emission**, the evidence that the reads
give for it, is the site likelihood of the genotype the two strands carry, summed over the alleles
they can carry:

$$
E(h_0, h_1) = \sum_{b_0 \in A_{\mathrm{c}}} \sum_{b_1 \in A_{\mathrm{c}}} P(b_0 \mid h_0) \, P(b_1 \mid h_1) \, \mathcal{L}\left(\lbrace b_0, b_1 \rbrace\right)
$$

and at ploidy 1, $E(h) = \sum_{b \in A_{\mathrm{c}}} P(b \mid h) \, \mathcal{L}(\lbrace b \rbrace)$.

## Mutation and escape

A strand that copies a panel haplotype $h$ carries $h$'s allele $a(h)$, or, by a **mutation**, any
other allele of the compact allele set:

$$
P(b \mid h) =
\begin{cases}
1 - \mu & b = a(h) \\
\mu / (\lvert A_{\mathrm{c}} \rvert - 1) & b \neq a(h)
\end{cases}
$$

$\mu$ is `--linkage-mutation`, $3 \times 10^{-3}$ by default. So an allele that no panel haplotype
carries is a mutation on the haplotype that the strand copies, and the strand keeps copying that
haplotype through it. A mutation can also explain an allele that other panel haplotypes carry,
where it costs less than switching to one of them and back. At a site with one allele there is
nothing to mutate to, and $P(a(h) \mid h) = 1$.

A strand has an **unknown allele** at a site when it copies a panel haplotype that does not pass
through the site. It carries each allele of the compact allele set with the same probability,
reduced by a fixed **escape** penalty $\epsilon_{\mathrm{esc}}$:

$$
P(b \mid h) = \frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{esc}}}{\lvert A_{\mathrm{c}} \rvert}
$$

`--linkage-mutation 0` turns mutation off. The model then adds a **wildcard** haplotype to the
panel, a state that carries an unknown allele at every site, and a strand can carry an allele that
no panel haplotype carries only by switching to the wildcard and back.

## Transitions

Between consecutive sites $d$ bases apart, each strand independently keeps copying the same
haplotype or, with probability $\rho(d)$, draws one uniformly from the $K$ panel haplotypes,
possibly the same one. A strand that copies $h$ at one site therefore copies $h'$ at the next with
probability

$$
(1 - \rho(d)) [h' = h] + \frac{\rho(d)}{K}
$$

where $[h' = h]$ is 1 when $h'$ is $h$ and 0 otherwise. The switch probability is

$$
\rho(d) = \left[ \rho_{\min} + (1 - \rho_{\min}) \left(1 - e^{-d/D}\right) \right]^{\omega}
$$

$d$ is the difference between two sites' positions (see
[Vocabulary](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#graph)), so a site's own length counts in its distance
to the next. $D$ is `--linkage-scale`. $\omega$ is `--linkage-weight`, an exponent on the switch
probability: a larger $\omega$ makes switches rarer and linkage stronger. `--linkage-weight 0`
turns the model off: every site keeps its direct call and is not phased from the panel. (The
formula at $\omega = 0$ would instead give $\rho = 1$.) $\rho_{\min}$ is a small fixed floor on the
bracketed term, so that $\rho(d) \geq \rho_{\min}^{\omega} > 0$ and every switch has a positive
probability.

The sites of an
[off-reference chain](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#which-child-chains-are-genotyped) have no
reference position of their own. vg takes an allele of the parent's chosen genotype that crosses
such a site, the one first in the parent's compact allele set where both do, and places the site
at the parent's position plus the site's offset along that allele. Two sites of one off-reference
chain are then as far apart as they are along that allele, and the chain's first site is as far
from the parent as its offset along that allele. No distance is known between such a site and any other
site with a reference position, and there $\rho = 1$.

## Genotype posterior

The forward–backward algorithm gives each state's posterior probability at each site. Each state
shares its probability among the genotypes $\lbrace b_0, b_1 \rbrace$ in proportion to
$P(b_0 \mid h_0) \, P(b_1 \mid h_1) \, \mathcal{L}(\lbrace b_0, b_1 \rbrace)$, the terms of its
emission, and a genotype's posterior collects its shares from every state. At ploidy 1 a state
shares its probability among the alleles in proportion to $P(b \mid h) \, \mathcal{L}(\lbrace b
\rbrace)$.

## Allele-frequency prior

A genotype that many pairs of panel haplotypes carry is implied by many states, so it collects more
probability. The rescaling below is applied to each site's posteriors after forward–backward, so
it changes that site's chosen genotype but not its neighbours' posteriors or the Viterbi path. The
exponent $F$, `--linkage-prior`, sets the prior's strength.

Write a strand's allele probability as a uniform part and a point mass,
$P(b \mid h) = u_h + k_h [b = a(h)]$: $u_h$ is $\mu / (\lvert A_{\mathrm{c}} \rvert - 1)$, or
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{esc}} / \lvert A_{\mathrm{c}} \rvert$ for an unknown allele, and $k_h$ is the
rest of $1 - \mu$, or 0. A state's share then splits into parts of three kinds, rescaled as
follows:

- The part where both strands **keep** their haplotypes' alleles goes to the genotype the pair
  carries, and is multiplied by $c_G^{F-1}$.
- The part where one strand keeps allele $a$ and the other takes the uniform part is multiplied by
  $n_a^{F-1}$, where $n_a$ is the number of panel haplotypes that carry $a$.
- The part where both strands take the uniform part is not rescaled.

At ploidy 1, the part of a state's share where the strand keeps allele $a$ is multiplied by
$n_a^{F-1}$, and the uniform part is not rescaled. The posteriors are then normalised to sum to 1.
$F = 1$ keeps the prior that the states imply, $F = 0$ removes it, and $F > 1$ strengthens it. The
model chooses the genotype with the highest posterior.

## Homopolymer sites

Sequencing errors in a long homopolymer run tend to recur in many reads at the same site, and the
site likelihood counts each such read as independent evidence. A larger exponent $F$ at a site like
this gives the panel's allele frequencies more weight against these reads.

`--hp-prior`, when not 0, replaces $F$ at **homopolymer sites**. At a homopolymer site, the
reference allele and some other candidate allele differ only in the length of one homopolymer run,
by at most a fixed number of copies of its base (see
[Fixed constants](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#fixed-constants)). The run must also be long: in
the longer of the two alleles it has at least `--hp-prior-run` bases, or it reaches an end of the
allele's sequence between its boundary nodes. A run that reaches an end can continue into a
boundary node, so its full length is unknown, and it counts as long.

## Forward–backward windows

vg runs the forward–backward algorithm over overlapping windows of a linkage chain. Each window
**keeps** a fixed number of consecutive sites, and the kept sites of successive windows cover the
chain without overlapping. A window also decodes a fixed margin of sites on each side of its kept
sites, fewer at the ends of the chain, and discards their posteriors. The windows are decoded
independently of one another. Every kept posterior therefore has the margin's number of sites on
each side, except near the ends of the linkage chain, and approximates the posterior from decoding
the whole chain at once. The first window of a chain below the top level starts as
[Linkage chains](#linkage-chains) describes, and every later window starts from a uniform
distribution. A linkage chain at ploidy 2 that starts from its parent's panel haplotypes is
decoded as one window, whatever its length.

## Linkage chains

The model runs on each linkage chain separately, one level of nested sites at a time, parents
before children (see [The linkage pass](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#the-linkage-pass)). A chain
below the top level is decoded after its parent's chain has been decoded and phased. The model then
starts the chain from the state that the parent's Viterbi path chose at the parent site (see
[Phasing from the panel](#phasing-from-the-panel)); read phasing, which comes later, does not change
it. A chain at its parent's ploidy holds the parent as its first site, fixed at the parent's chosen
genotype, with all its probability on that state. A ploidy-1 chain under a diploid parent does not
hold the parent. It starts from the panel haplotype $h$ that the parent's strand carrying the chain
copies, moved by one transition over the distance $d$ from the parent to the chain's first site:
probability $1 - \rho(d) + \rho(d)/K$ on $h$ and $\rho(d)/K$ on each other state, so
that the first site's reads can overrule the parent's haplotype. The chain starts from a uniform
distribution instead when the parent was not phased, or, at ploidy 1, when that strand copies a
panel haplotype that does not pass through the chain's first site.

## Phasing from the panel

vg phases each linkage chain from its **Viterbi path**: the most probable sequence of the model's
states along the chain, found window by window (below), given each site's chosen genotype $G$. For
the path, a state's emission is the probability that its two strands carry $G$'s alleles, in
either order, times $\mathcal{L}(G)$. A state whose haplotypes carry $G$'s alleles is therefore
preferred, and the path keeps a strand's haplotype through a mutation where a switch and back would
cost more. Phasing orders each chosen genotype's alleles to match the path's haplotypes, and keeps
the genotype. The order of a heterozygous site's alleles is arbitrary where the path's two
haplotypes carry the same allele there, or where neither carries either chosen allele, since
either strand could then carry either (see [Phasing](read-likelihood-genotyping.md#phasing)). Read
phasing, when on, re-decides the phases afterwards (see
[Read phasing](read-likelihood-read-phasing.md#read-phasing)).

A site decoded at an earlier level, such as a parent decoded with its child chain, is held to the
state it was phased with, where that state can carry its chosen genotype, and otherwise only to
its genotype. On every linkage chain, the path is decoded over overlapping
windows of the sizes given in [Forward–backward windows](#forwardbackward-windows). Each window
after the first is held, at the previous window's last kept site, to the state that the previous
window chose there.
